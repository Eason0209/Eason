<p class="highlight">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something needs to be done—like dragging a big black plastic sack through the upstairs rooms, emptying into it each waste basket, the trash of three lives for a week or so. I am careful and slow about it, so that this little chore will banish the big ones. But I leave the bag lying on the floor and I go into my daughter’s bedroom, into the north morning light from her windows, and while this minute she is at school counting or spelling a first useful word I sit down on her unmade bed and I look out the windows at nothing for a while, the unmoving buildings—houses and a church—in the <span class="highlight">cold street.</span></p>

<p> <em><big>When it is finally ours,</big></em> this freedom, <div>this liberty,</div> <div>beautiful
    and terrible thing,</div> <div>needful to man as air,</div>   
    usable as earth; when it belongs at last to all,   
    when it is truly instinct, brain matter, diastole, systole,   
    reflex action; when it is finally won; when it is more   
    than the gaudy mumbo jumbo of politicians:   
    <ol>
        <li>this man,</li> 
        <li>this Douglass,</li> 
        <li>this former slave,</li> 
        <li>this Negro</li>   
    </ol>
    <ul>   
    <li>beaten to his knees, exiled, visioning a world   
    where none is lonely, none hunted, alien,   
    this man, superb in love and logic, this man   
    shall be remembered. Oh, not with statues’ rhetoric,   
    not with legends and poems and wreaths of bronze alone,
    but with the lives grown out of his life, the lives   
    fleshing his dream of the beautiful, <small>needful thing.</small></li>
