        <p class="big"> <em>When it is finally</em>  ours, this <span class="down">freedom</span>, this liberty, this beautiful
        and terrible thing, <br>needful to man as air,   
        usable as c earth</span>;
         when it belongs at last to all,   
        <span class="down">when it is truly instinct,</span> brain matter, diastole, systole,   
        reflex action; when it is finally won;</p>
       <p class="big1"> When it is more
        than the gaudy <span class="down">mumbo jumbo</span> of politicians:   
        this man, this <span class="down">Douglass</span>, this former slave, this Negro   
        <span class="down">beaten to his knees,</span> exiled, visioning a world   
        where none is lonely, none hunted, alien,  
        this man, superb in love and logic, this man   
        shall be <span class="down">remembered.</span>
         Oh, not with statuesâ€™ rhetoric,   
        not with <span class="down">legends and poems and wreaths</span> of bronze alone,
        but with the <span class="down">lives grown out of his life,</span> the lives   
        fleshing his dream of the beautiful, needful thing.
