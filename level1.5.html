    <h1>Frederick Douglass</h1>
    <h2>by ROBERT HAYDEN</h2>
    
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h<br>&nbsp;e<br>&nbsp;n<br>&nbsp; <br>
        it is finally ours, this freedom, this liberty, this beautiful
            and terrible thing, needful to man as air,   
            usable as earth; when it belongs at last to all,   
            when it is truly instinct, b&nbsp;r&nbsp;a&nbsp;i&nbsp;n matter, diastole, systole,   
            reflex action; when it is finally won; when it is more   
            than the gaudy mumbo jumbo of politicians:   
            this man, this Douglass, this former s&nbsp;l&nbsp;a&nbsp;v&nbsp;e, this Negro   
            beaten to <br>his knees, exiled, visioning a w&nbsp;o&nbsp;r&nbsp;l&nbsp;d   
            where none is lonely, <br>none hunted, a&nbsp;l&nbsp;i&nbsp;e&nbsp;n,   
            this man, <br>superb in love and logic, this man   
            shall be <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remembered. Oh, not with statuesâ€™ rhetoric,   
            not with legends and poems and wreaths of bronze alone,
            but with the lives grown out of his life, the lives   
            fleshing his dream of the beautiful, needful thing.
