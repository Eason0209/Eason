    <p><div class="answer"><big><big>When</big></big> it is finally ours, this freedom, this liberty, this beautiful
        and terrible thing, needful to man as air,   
        usable as earth; when it belongs at last to all,   
        when it is truly instinct, brain matter, diastole, systole,   
        reflex action; when it is finally won; when it is more   
        than the <span class="down">gaudy mumbo jumbo</span> of politicians:   
        this man, this Douglass, this former slave, this Negro   
        beaten to his knees, exiled, visioning a world   
        where none is lonely, none hunted, <small><small>alien</small></small>,   
        this man, superb in love and logic, this man   
        shall be &nbsp; remembered. Oh, not with statuesâ€™ rhetoric,   
        not with legends and poems and wreaths of bronze alone,
        but with the lives grown out of his life, the lives   
        fleshing his dream of the beautiful, needful thing.</div>
