<h4>When it is finally ours, this freedom, this liberty, this beautiful
    <li></li>and terrible thing, needful to man as air,   
    usable as earth; when it belongs at last to all,   
    when it is truly instinct, <h1><big>brain</big></h1> matter, diastole, systole,   
    reflex action; when it is finally won; when it is more   
    than the gaudy mumbo jumbo of politicians:   
    this man, <h2>this ,<small> Douglass,</small></h2> <h5>this former slave,</h5> <h1>this Negro   
    beaten to his knees,</h1> <em>exiled, visioning a world   
    where none is lonely, none hunted, alien,   
    this man, superb in love and logic, <div>this man   
    shall be remembered.</div> Oh, not with statuesâ€™ rhetoric,   
    not with legends and poems and wreaths of bronze alone,
    but with the lives grown out of his life, <strong> lives   
    fleshing his dream of the beautiful, needful thing.</strong>
