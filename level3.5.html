        <div><p> When it is finally<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ours, this <span class="down">freedom</span>, this liberty, this beautiful
        and terrible thing, <br>needful to man as air,   
        usable as <span class="down"> earth</span>;
        when it belongs at last to all,   
        <span class="down">when it is truly instinct,</span> brain matter, diastole, systole,   
        reflex action; when it is finally won;</p>
    
        
   <p>  When it is more
        than the gaudy mumbo jumbo of politicians:   
        this man, this Douglass, this former slave, this Negro   
        beaten to his knees, exiled, visioning a world   
        where none is lonely, none hunted, alien,   
        this man, superb in love and logic, this man   
        shall be remembered. Oh, not with statuesâ€™ rhetoric,   
        not with legends and poems and wreaths of bronze alone,
        but with the lives grown out of his life, the lives   
        fleshing his dream of the beautiful, needful thing.
