    <em><ul><div class="qusetion">it is finally ours, this freedom, this liberty, this beautiful
    and terrible thing,</div> <div class="answer">needful to man as air,   
    usable as earth; </ul><ul><strong>when it belongs at last to all,   
    when it is truly instinct, brain matter, diastole, systole,   
    reflex action;</div></strong></em> <strong> it is finally won;</strong><small> when it is more   
    than the gaudy mumbo jumbo of politicians:</small>   
    <big><big>this man, this Douglass, this former slave, this Negro</big></big>   
    beaten to his knees, exiled, visioning a world   
    where none is lonely, ,<li>none hunted,</li> alien,   
    this man, superb in love and logic, this man   
    shall be remembered. Oh, not with statuesâ€™ rhetoric,   
    not with legends and poems and wreaths of bronze alone,
    but with the lives grown out of</ul> <big><strong><ol>his life,</ol> </strong></big> <ul>lives   
    fleshing his dream of the beautiful, needful thing.</ul>
